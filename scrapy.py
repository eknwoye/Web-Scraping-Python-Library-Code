#  **Scrapy**: This is a more advanced framework specifically designed for web crawling and scraping. It provides powerful features for extracting data from # websites at scale. Here's a basic example of how to create a scraper using Scrapy:

# To install these libraries, you can use pip:
# pip install beautifulsoup4, scrapy


import scrapy

class MySpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'myspider'
    start_urls = ['https://www.example.com']

    def parse(self, response):

        # Extract data using XPath or CSS selectors

        title = response.css('title::text').get()
        yield {
            'title': title,
            }
